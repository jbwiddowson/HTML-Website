<h1> Why you should hire me? </h1>
	<b1>You should hire me because I am very well spoken and a hard working. I also know you will not be disappointed in the work I do for your company. I also try my best to bring a lot to the team especially with the communication . A  team that communicates well is a good team and if I have questions or any problems I will discuss them with my team or I will figure it out.  &nbsp; </b1>
