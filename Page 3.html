<h1>About Me</h1>
 <b1 class="d">I am Jacob Brandon Widdowson and I love to play video games its my favorite thing to do in my free time. When Im not playing video games Im usually outside weightlife or doing other sports. Soccer is probably my favorite sport to play but I love watching football every season to. Skiing is also one of my favorite hobbies but I never usually get to do it because of how much time it takes up. I love music as well it gives me a lot of motivation and it helps me a lot in life. I've been going to Wake Tech for almost a year now which its very exciting because I feel I am making a big step in my life. I love learning I get very excited to learn and when you figure something out its very satifying. I hope you like my resume and I appreciate you spending your time reading my work.
